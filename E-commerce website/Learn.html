            <h3> <u>How sustainable are we?</u></h3>
            <br>
            <p> 
             1.) Return : 
              Grubstation's has a 100% recyclable policy. All our bottle and recyled bottles. We have 
              recyle bins in every of our store. We also make sure to remind our customers.Recycling lowers 
              the need for new raw materials to be grown, harvested, or extracted from the Earth. As a result, 
              the harmful disruption and damage to the natural environment is reduced: Fewer trees are cut down, 
              rivers are diverted, wild creatures are hurt or displaced, and water, soil, and air pollutants are reduced.
              <br><br>
              2.) Regrow : No product of our is wasted. Every fruit is used for the next customer or if there are left overs
              it will be distrubed for free with the app called LeftOvers.
              <br><br>
              3.) Reduce
              We reduce the amount of waste by only making products based on orders per day.Waste contributes to climate change, 
              pollutes the environment, and wastes more money, energy, and natural resources than most of us know. Small changes 
              in our daily life can have a big impact on the health of all living beings, as well as the province and planet we call home.</p>
